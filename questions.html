<h1>What are inline elements ?</h1>
<h3>Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.</h3>
<h1>What are block elements ?</h1>
<h3>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Two commonly used block elements are: "p" and "div" .</h3>
<h1>Difference between div and p tag</h1>
<h3>The major web browsers will render a " p " tag with margin above and below the paragraph. A  "div " tag will be rendered without any margin at all.</h3>
